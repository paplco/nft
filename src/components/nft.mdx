# Arbitrum ReFi: Bridging Blockchain, Real-World Agroforestry Projects, and Verified Data

## Introduction

Ekonavi is proud to introduce a groundbreaking NFT collection that leverages blockchain technology to foster the bioeconomy through real-world agroforestry projects. This collection goes beyond typical digital assets by linking each NFT to a physical project with verifiable impact in biodiversity, fair supply chains, and carbon sequestration. 

These NFTs are not just digital representations; they are backed by data provided directly by the projects, offering transparency and accountability to investors and stakeholders.

## The Bond Between Agroforestry, Blockchain & Coordination

The purpose of the ReFi ecosystem is mainly concerned with governance and resource allocation for irl regenerative projects.

Given its origins in the Global South, Ekonavi begins with the proposal to optimize resource allocation in agroforestry projects by using its status as the largest validator on the Regen Network to distribute resources to projects that regularly report their results.

The allocation model also follows a decentralized approach, where the community curates the allocation process. However, certain steps are necessary to scale our reach and increase the volume of our support.

> **Decentralization of Governance:** Ekonavi is a company offering a unique solution to meet the demands of agroforestry projects seeking support, companies looking to offset their emissions, and investors wanting exposure to the bioeconomy directly linked to agroforestry. As we grow, supported by a community of over 700 projects and strategic partnerships, we recognize the opportunity to transfer part of the governance to this community.

> **Action Point:** The projects listed in this first cohort will be the first invited to participate in governance, and the buyers of the NFTs for these respective projects will also be eligible to receive the governance token airdrop.

> **Capital Allocation:** Recognizing the global challenge of allocating capital in the bioeconomy, we curated projects ranked according to their maturity and capacity so that investors can build direct partnerships while also participating in Ekonavi's governance.

> **Action Point:** Through a partnership with **[ReFaz](https://refaz.xyz)**, Ekonavi offers free mediation between investors and companies seeking execution projects in Brazil, and a network of projects capable of executing, monitoring, and reporting data. The goal of this mediation is to ensure access to quality data for investors and companies and fair agreements for the listed ecological agroforestry projects.

In line with this vision, over the past seven months, we have dedicated ourselves to building solid partnerships to ensure liquidity and access to technology for the network of projects that rely on Ekonavi for support. The launch of this collection formalizes our commitment to governance decentralization.

By purchasing NFTs from this collection, users automatically become eligible for the governance token airdrop that will be distributed, in the first generation, to the listed projects. The higher the ranking of the acquired NFTs, the greater the share of governance tokens the user will receive. (That’s why we limited the first mint to 10 per project)

We aim to empower agroforestry projects to establish direct, fair, and efficient relationships with Web3.

## Data Integrity and Verification

The data underpinning each NFT in this collection is sourced directly from the ecological-agroforestry projects themselves. Two layers of verification ensure the credibility of this information:  

1. **Community Curation:** Agroforestry experts and practitioners within the Ekonavi community continuously review and validate the claims made by each project. This ongoing peer review is facilitated through regular updates posted on the Ekonavi platform, which doubles as a social media and data reporting hub.  

2. **Project Curation:** The projects featured in the first cohort were meticulously selected by the Ekonavi team and community, ensuring only credible and impactful initiatives are included. These are not just digital projects—they are tangible, real-world initiatives that anyone can visit and verify.

### Data Collection Framework

Ekonavi uses the ISSB (IFRS 1 & 2) standards as the foundation for data collection, ensuring alignment with international financial reporting standards. However, recognizing the unique challenges faced by agroforestry projects, Ekonavi has "humanized" the data collection process, making it accessible for farmers. 

The data is collected through user-friendly Tally forms, and the projects that participated in live online sessions to learn about web3, carbon markets, and liquidity for sustainable projects. 

This approach not only standardizes the data but also empowers project owners with the knowledge to engage with blockchain technology.

### Ranking and Pricing of NFTs

Each NFT in the collection is ranked based on the potential impact of the project it represents. The ranking system is built on three key criteria:  

1. Community and Team Curation: Inclusion in the collection signifies that a project has been vetted by both the Ekonavi team and its community.  
2. Data Completeness: Projects are ranked higher if they provide comprehensive and reliable data, showcasing their capacity to report and deliver on their promises.  
3. Certification: Projects that receive additional certification from the Ekonavi advisory board are awarded higher rankings.

The price of each NFT starts at $10 and increases by $5 for each level in the ranking system, which ranges from CCC to AAA. This ranking reflects the project's potential for impact and the level of governance the project will gain at Ekonavi DAO. The higher the ranking of the asset purchased, the higher the airdrop of governance tokens that the owner will be able to claim.

### Direct Access to Projects

One of the distinguishing features of the Ekonavi NFT collection is the direct relationship it fosters between buyers and the projects. Unlike traditional middlemen, Ekonavi ensures that buyers have direct access to the data suppliers, facilitating a transparent and fair relationship. This approach addresses one of the most significant challenges in the compensation market—efficient capital allocation—by focusing on micro-data from projects that are visible, verifiable, and grounded in the real world.

## The Assets

###  **Categories** 

   - Biodiversity: Each asset will represent the biodiversity impact of a specific project, such as the preservation of species, restoration of native vegetation, or enhancement of ecological corridors.  
   - Fair Supply Chains: These assets will reflect the social impact of ensuring fair trade and equitable practices within the supply chain, focusing on fair wages, ethical sourcing, and support for small-scale farmers.  
   - Carbon: Carbon assets will quantify the carbon sequestration achieved by the agroforestry projects, including details on the amount of carbon offset and the methodologies used for measurement.

### NFT Structure

1. Image  
2. Name of the project at Ekonavi   
3. Link of the project at Ekonavi  
4. Name of the steward  
5. Mini bio of the project  
6. Rank of the project according to Ekonavi Web3 Cohort  
7. Link to the answers of the project at Ekonavi cohort (Metadata about intentions, biodiversity, etc - just for buyers)

### Framework

   - Visual Representation: The NFTs can be visually designed to reflect their impact categories, using color coding or icons to easily distinguish between Biodiversity, Fair Supply Chains, and Carbon assets.  
   - Impact Dashboard: A dashboard on Ekonavi could aggregate data from these NFTs, offering users a comprehensive view of the overall impact generated by the cohort of projects. This dashboard could show totals for biodiversity, fair trade improvements, and carbon sequestration.  
   - Interactivity: Allow NFT holders to interact with the data, possibly through periodic updates or the ability to view real-time changes in the project's impact, ensuring the assets are dynamic and continuously valuable.

### Market and Utility (what buyers gain)

   - Access to a curated list of mature ecological-agroforestry projects in BrazilBrasil with the capacity to plan, execute, and report (through international standards such as the ISSB) on sustainability and regenerative ventures.  
   - Access to future governance features on the Ekonavi DAO (buying from B & A projects will give access to the future airdrop of governance tokens)

###  **Verification and Transparency**

   - Blockchain Verification: Ensure that each NFT's metadata is verifiable on-chain, providing transparency and trust for potential buyers and stakeholders.  
   - Impact Audits: Periodically audit the impact data to maintain the credibility and accuracy of the NFT collection, with the results published on both Ekonavi and Arbitrum.

### Ratings

The NFT assets are categorized into seven levels, from CCC to AAA:  
- CCC: Basic capability to execute and report on regenerative projects, ideal for donations.  
- CCB: Ability to execute small projects with basic reporting.  
- CBB: Mid-low potential with plans to enhance infrastructure and reporting.  
- BBB: Mid potential, eligible for grants up to $10k with deliverable reporting.  
- BBA: Mid-high potential, capable of handling grants up to $20k with a legal structure.  
- BAA: High potential, with the ability to manage up to $50k and adhere to legal frameworks.  
- AAA: Maximum potential, eligible for up to $100k, fully compliant with reporting and legal standards.
